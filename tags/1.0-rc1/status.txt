This document describes the current implementation status (thigs
left to do, actually).

Documentation:

  - Clarify whether the dispatcher is called for a connection
    request that failed immediately (probably this should not
    happen if the request haven't been scheduled).

DNS Resolver:

  - Introduce an error code for malformed host names (ones that
    contain more than one dot in a row).

  - Compare the stored request with the request section in the
    response packet before parsing it.

  - Implement a way to specify an alternative domain name for
    numeric address resolution (instead of "in-addr.arpa").
    Perhaps a version of rascal_gethost() that accepts a host
    name and performs PTR RR resolution would be enough.

Generic:

  - Analyze all interlocked code and the possibility to replace
    per-connection mutexes with one static spinlock.
